🚀 Power BI Dashboard Project – OnePlus Sales Analysis 📊

I’m excited to share my recent project on OnePlus smartphone sales analysis, guided by Mr. Sathish Dhavale.

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides deep insights into sales performance with:

✅ KPIs – Total Quantity, Total Sales, Transactions & Average Sales
✅ Sales Trends – By Month & Day
✅ Model-wise Performance – OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 9, etc.
✅ Payment Method Distribution – Cash, UPI, Debit/Credit Cards
✅ Geo Insights – Sales by City across India

📍 Highlights:

11.63M+ sales from 288 units sold across major cities

Dynamic filters for Month, Day, Model, Payment Method & Brand

Combination of line, bar, pie & map visuals for impactful storytelling

Through this project, I strengthened my expertise in:
🔹 Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)
🔹 Data Modeling & DAX
🔹 Dashboard Design & Interactive Visualizations (Power BI)
